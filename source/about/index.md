## Intro
I am currently working as an advanced cloud native engineer in Cloud-Container && Hybrid-Cloud Team of System R&D Department of [Trip.com Group](https://www.ctrip.com).
My work focuses on the construction of Trip.com Group Hybrid-Cloud IaC platform based on [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) && [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). My professional interest focuses on **Hybrid-Cloud IaC**, **Linux**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **AI Infra**.
What's more, I also have a strong interest on **English**.

Before that, I got my MSc degree in Computer Science from Boston University in January 2021 and BEng degree in Computer Science and Technology in Soochow University(Suzhou) in June 2019.

+ Developed a system based on Android that can recognize the current operating hand by analyzing the user’s sliding screen trace
+ Collected data of sample points in several known classified sliding traces with Android’s event response mechanism and calculated feature vector for each trace from length, velocity, displacement, shape four aspects.
+ Used Weka to train and evaluate models under different classification algorithms
+ Used the model with the best performance to predict the class of newly generated sliding traces
